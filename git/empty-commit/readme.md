# Create and push empty Git commit
## Description
Script for automatic creation and push of empty commit in a Git repository.

## Languages
### Shell
#### Run
In order to start the script type:
```shell
bash script.sh
```

Or make the script executable:
```shell
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Ranaming it to `empty-commit` and putting it in a directory added to `PATH` can serve as handy command:

```shell
# in directory added to PATH
mv script.sh empty-commit
chmod +x empty-commit

# in any directory
empty-commmit
```
