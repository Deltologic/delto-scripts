## Getting started
The repository is divided into directories matchng every app/system for which there are scripts provided. Individual scripts are then provided in subfolders of parent app folder. For each scripts there is deidacated readme provided, which explains what the script does and how to build & run it.

Primarly, scripts are implemented in JavaScript with some of them providing complemetary implementation in Python (contributions are welcome here ðŸš€).

Each script contains its own confuguration files: `package.json` for JavaScript and `requirements.txt` for Python. Necessary dependencies will be installed by typing respecively `npm i` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the script directory. For Python scripts we reccomend using vitual environments. More on buiding and running the scripts can be found in each script's readme or in the `_template/readme.md` file.

In case of any questions regarding the scripts, as well as if you have new script idea, feature request or a bug report, feel free to post us an issue. Before doing so, please take a look on our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
